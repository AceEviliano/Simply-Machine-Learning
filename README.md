# Simply-Machine-Learning

This is a repository that contains selected Machine Learing topics, with detailed notes and worked out problems. 


## Topics 

 1. __Linear Regression__
    - [Notes](https://github.com/AceEviliano/Simply-Machine-Learning/blob/main/Linear%20Regression/Notes.ipynb)
    - [Questions and Answers (Q&A)](https://github.com/AceEviliano/Simply-Machine-Learning/blob/main/Linear%20Regression/Questions%20and%20Answers%20(Q%26A).pdf)
    - [__Case Study:__ Predicting Crime Rate from Boston Housing dataset](https://github.com/AceEviliano/Simply-Machine-Learning/blob/main/Linear%20Regression/Crime%20Rate%20prediction%20on%20Boston%20Housing%20dataset.ipynb)
    > The notes contains detailed analysis that can be performed on linear models in practice, while the case study considers more data to day aspects like dealing with higher dimensional data, data biases and much more. While the case study does perform many of the analysis shown in the notebook, it does not include all of it. More emphasis is given on understanding the later. Section (Q&A) contains some preliminary questions that test the understanding of the notes presented accompanied alongside with their answers.
    
 2. __Logistic Regression__
    - [Notes](https://github.com/AceEviliano/Simply-Machine-Learning/blob/main/Logistic%20Regression/Logistic%20Regression%20(Notes).ipynb)
    - [Questions and Answers (Q&A)](https://github.com/AceEviliano/Simply-Machine-Learning/blob/main/Logistic%20Regression/Question%20and%20Answers%20(Q%26A).ipynb)
    - [__Case Study:__ Predicting mpg efficiency in Auto Dataset](https://github.com/AceEviliano/Simply-Machine-Learning/blob/main/Logistic%20Regression/Case%20Study%20-%20Predicting%20mpg%20efficiency%20in%20Auto%20Dataset.ipynb)
    > The notes contains an introductory view of moving from continuous targets to qualitative nominal targets. The question and answer illustrates the motivational move from linear regression for nominal targets to logistic regression over nominal targets. The notes also contains other details pertaining to metrics and visualizations pertaining to classification problem, used in literature.
